# Contributing

If you would like to contribute to the repository, first identify the scale of what you would like to contribute. If it is small (grammar/spelling or a bug fix) feel free to start working on a fix. If you are submitting a feature or substantial design contribution, please [discuss it](../discussions) first. You might also read these two blogs posts on contributing code: [Open Source Contribution Etiquette](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Dec-31.html) by Miguel de Icaza and [Don't "Push" Your Pull Requests](https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/) by Ilya Grigorik. Note that all submissions will be rigorously reviewed and verified by the team, and only those that meet an extremely high bar for quality, design, and relevance will be merged into the source.
